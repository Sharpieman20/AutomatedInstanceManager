=== What AIM does

AIM uses a link:STATES.adoc[state transition model] to guarantee only a certain number of instances are running at any given time.

This allows runners to use an infinite number of instances in theory, even if their computer can only support 2 or 3 at any given time.

A short demonstration of using 18 instances is available link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZWgRNDrRcc[here].

**WARNING - AIM can have the effect of shortening your SSD's lifespan. Please read link:MEMORY.adoc[our memory briefer] for more details.**

Please note this demo is of an early version of the macro, and we expect to improve performance and utility in the future.

More details coming soon, for now please read link:INSTALLING.adoc[our installation guide] on information of how to start using AIM, and out link:SETTINGS.adoc[our settings guide] for other information about it.
