=== What AIM does

AIM uses a state transition model to guarantee only a certain number of instances are running at any given time.

A short demonstration of using 18 instances is available link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZWgRNDrRcc[here].

Please note this demo is of an early version of the macro, and we expect to improve performance and utility in the future.

More details coming soon, for now please read link:INSTALLING.adoc[our installation guide] on information of how to start using AIM, and out link:SETTINGS.adoc[our settings guide] for other information about it.
