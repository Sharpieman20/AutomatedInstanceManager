== Prerequisites

It's assumed you are running Windows 8/10, and you have Python 3 and AHK installed.

MultiMC is required, and OBS is strongly recommended. Internet connection is also required.

== Instance setup

Create an instance in MultiMC called "1.16INST", and set it as your first instance in MultiMC.

Configure it with all of the mods/resource packs/maps that you want.

Then duplicate it until you have as many instances as you want to play with, with the name scheme "1.16INST1", "1.16INST2", "1.16INST3", etc.

Here's an example using 6 instances:

== OBS Setup

OBS Websocket is required for having the macro manage your OBS environment. You can install it link:https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/obs-websocket-remote-control-obs-studio-from-websockets.466/[here]. Make sure you download version 4.9.1.

Once this is done, you want to create an OBS Source (window capture or game capture) for each instance. They should have the following name scheme:

- active1
- active2
- active3
- ...
- activeN

== Starting the macro

When you're ready to use the macro, link:https://github.com/Sharpieman20/AutomatedInstanceManager/releases/download/v1.0.0/run_aim.py[click here] to download run_aim.py, or get it from the link:https://github.com/Sharpieman20/AutomatedInstanceManager/releases[releases tab].

Right click on run_aim.py, select "Open With Python", and the macro will start up. If you don't have an "Open With -> Python" option, then try double clicking on it instead. If that still doesn't work, your Python is likely installed incorrectly.

This will download other files into the folder with run_aim.py, and then give an error.

After this, you'll need to set your settings in my_settings.json, which should've been downloaded.

Change "multi-mc-path" to be the location of your MultiMC executable, and you should be good to go.

Each time you want to start the macro from then on, simply right click on run_aim.py and "Open With Python".

For more advanced configuration, see link:SETTINGS.adoc[our settings guide].
